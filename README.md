## Reviews_Classification-AmazonAlexa

    Model that will predict if the persons review on a product is positive or negative feedback. 
    We will perform EDA to a specific dataset and then predict the nature of a review.
    
## Dataset

  The dataset used in this project is the Amazon fabrics dataset. It contains over 30,150 reviews of fabric products on Amazon, along with information such as the review text, product ID, user ID, and more. 
  For this project, we will be using only the review text and the corresponding sentiment (positive or negative).
  
## Exploratory Data Analysis

  Before building a model, we will perform EDA on the dataset to gain insights and understand the characteristics of the data. 
  Some of the tasks we will perform in EDA are:

    - Data cleaning: removing duplicates, handling missing values, etc.
    - Text preprocessing: tokenizing, removing stop words, stemming or lemmatizing, etc.
    - Word frequency analysis: identifying the most common words and visualizing their frequencies using word clouds or histograms.
    - Sentiment analysis: determining the distribution of positive and negative reviews in the dataset and visualizing the sentiment using bar charts or pie charts.
    
## Model Training

  After completing EDA, we will train a model to predict the nature of a review as either positive or negative. We will use NLP techniques such as bag-of-words and term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) to transform the review text into numerical features that can be fed into a machine learning algorithm. 

## Conclusion

  In conclusion, this project involves performing EDA on the Alexa's product Reviews dataset and training a machine learning model to predict the nature of a review as either positive or negative. 
  By completing this project, we can gain insights into the characteristics of the dataset and develop a model that can be used to automatically classify reviews in future applications.
